# PacMan-Exercise
Created by Christopher Morel.

This was an assignment from the Fullstack Development with MERN bootcamp via MITxPRO. This app is a reflection of my understanding and knowledge of Week 7 as exhibited by the functioning web app. 

How to run: 
First click the start game button to initialize the game, and follow that action by clicking the Add Pacman button to add a Pacman into the mix. 
The more you click start game the faster the pacmen will move.
The more you click add Pacman the more pacmen will show on screen.
Have Fun.
 
Road-map of future improvements:
I would like to create a reset, and stop button for this so that the user doesn't have to refresh the page to reset the app.
I would like to add more edge detection so that the pacmen don't crash into eachother
I would like to routes for the pacmen just like in the game.
I would also like to style the buttons so the opacity is more transparent
I would love to make this in to a full on game.
